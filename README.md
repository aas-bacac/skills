# Table of contents
- [skills.md](skills.md)
  - This list of skills is meant to be a resource for the skills astronomers may need in transitioning out of academia.
  - Where possible, we list existing skills many astronomers already have that are transferable to various non-academic fields.
  - This list of skills is NOT meant to be a tutorial on how to obtain these skills.
 
# TODO before we make this public
- clean up commit history
- Try to add at least one more discipline besides data science
