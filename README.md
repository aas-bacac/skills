# This repository has currently under development!
This is a repository for skills astronomers might need in transitioning into industries like data science and aerospace.  In some cases astronomers already have the requisite skills, they just need to learn how to translate what they already know, while in other cases astronomers will need to learn them.

# Table of contents
- [skills.md](skills.md)
  - This list of skills is meant to be a resource for the skills astronomers may need in transitioning out of academia.
  - Where possible, we list existing skills many astronomers already have that are transferable to various non-academic fields.
  - This list of skills is NOT meant to be a tutorial on how to obtain these skills.
 
# TODO
- clean up commit history
- Try to add at least one more discipline besides data science
- add edit/comment instructions
- Add list authorship in some way (names and/or organizations)
- Consider converting this into a github wiki (only possible when repo is public)
