# Skills astronomers need to transition outside of academia
For some skills on this list, we'll specifically call out the equivalent skills astronomers generally already know along with these skill's industry analogues.  We use "industry" here to mean positions/fields that are outside of academia like those in tech, industry, government, etc.
## Data Science
- SQL
  - astronomy equivalent: Create a SDSS-based sample of galaxies based on X, Y, and Z criteria to study A. Translate this to a sql-query to extract data from the SDSS online database.
  - industry: Create a sample of customers based on X, Y, and Z criteria to study A. Translate this to a sql-query to extract data from your company's database.
- Metrics dashboards
  - astronomy equivalent: Derive measurable quantities that directly probe the physics of object class X.  Report out these quantities to the astro community and draw conclusions about X.
  - industry: Derive measurable quantities that directly probe the behavior of all customers or important subsets of customers.  Build a dashboard webpage that is automatically updated from your company's database to allow the company to make informed decision with real-time information.
- Machine Learning
  - classical vs Deep Learning
  - linear models
  - tree-based models
  - deep Learning's particular success for images, text, and audio
  - when to use deep learning vs classical machine learning
  - generative AI for images, text, and audio
- AB testing
  - pros and cons of AB testing vs simple metrics monitoring
  - basic AB testing statistics
    - p-values, t-test, etc
    - power analysis
    - Seasonality gotchas
- Software Engineering
  - Basic data structures and when to use them (lists, queues, stacks, hashmaps/dictionaries, trees).  The ability the solve simple problems using these data structures and reason about your solutions's time and space complexity (aka "leetcoding").
  - basic pros/cons and uses of compiled languages (e.g. c++, Java) vs interpreted languages (python). Be able to give a basic outline for why python has become so popular for machine learning and scientific computing.
